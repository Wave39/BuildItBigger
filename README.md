# BuildItBigger
This is the repository for the BuildItBigger app, which is part of the Udacity Android Nanodegree program.

## Building the app
There are no special requirements necessary to build and run the app. Keep in mind that there are two product flavors, a 'lite' version that displays an ad, and a 'pro' version that does not display an ad. You can change this from the Build Variants window in Android Studio.
